Special attention
Each student should be given ample opportunity to use computer system for the assigned project work. Sample format of project work could be given to the students before assigning the work.
The computer system must have required necessary software packages and program installed in order to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. Teacher could guide students during the development work assign to students. Generally, individual project is more preferable because he/she can learn more on project but project work can be done in group (maximum of 5 persons in each group).
